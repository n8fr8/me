<p>I have worked for over twenty years in the field of mobile communications and security software and systems, with a deep set of experience organizations, applications and platforms. In 1999, I founded ThinAirApps, a mobile enterprise software startup that developed a pioneering secure mobile email and business application platform. We were acquired by Palm, inc in 2001, where I led the mobile Java initiative in partnership with IBM, Sun and others. After a few years there, I left to apply my technical and security skills to humanitarian, human rights and civic applications, by working with human rights organizations and government initiatives, and teaching graduate students at New York University how to do the same. Since 2009, I have led the Guardian Project, an award-winning, open-source, mobile security effort with millions users worldwide, thanks to grant funding from Google, the Knight Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, HIVOS and Eric and Wendy Schmidt. I am also currently a Affiliate Fellow, at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, at Harvard University.</p>

This paper describes the most recent of these efforts, a three-tier client-server architecture that relies heavily on a middleware layer to present a single uniform set of interfaces to multiple heterogeneous servers. The work described herein has been supported by the NSF-DARPA-NASA Digital Libraries Initiative, under cooperative agreement NSF IR94-11330.”</li>
